# Homework week 1 | Refactor

This week I was tasked with cleaning up a webpage so that it met basic accessibility standards. The nav links didn't work, the css had a lot of duplicated work and didn't contain comments. I added this ReadMe to explain what I did.

## Some items that were refactored:
* the many `<div>`'s were replaced with sematic HTML elements (i.e.header, nav, aside, etc)
* added an anchor tags to make the nav links functional
* added a descriptive title
* added `alt` tags to images for better accessibility
* removed duplicate css classes and called just the one in the HTML
